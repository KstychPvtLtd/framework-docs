### Docker Based Deployment
This app, use docker contrainer to run laravel, low code module over it and other stuff in a complete virtual environment that automatically generate everytime new image whenever we start this app using **kstych.sh** script.

To keep record of User File Settings and Modules Safe from Docker Regeneration cycle. There is a data folder available in host system, mounted into every docker contrainer.

So, Whener developer create new modules or files, that data is stored in Host machine data folder mounted into docker contrainer. so, this method keeps data folder safe from docker Regeneration Cycle and also, makes it easy to keep data as a Github Repo.



## Basic Folder Structure

As explained above a "data" folder is created by the docker script for all persistence requirement, there are following sub directories
```
data
|----custom                             : code directory for version control
|    |----app                           : laravel storage/app folder, you will find all your local-storage files here
|    |    |----public                   : laravel storage/app/public folder
|    |    |----temp                     : temp dir user by application to manage temporary files
|    |----ext                           : all configuration and code parent directory
|    |    |----assets                   : public assets folder mapped to /public/custom/*
|    |    |----config                   : framework configuration files
|    |    |    |----lang                : language files
|    |    |    |----models              : Model configuration (generated by framework)
|    |    |    |----modules             : Application Modules definitions (generated by framework)
|    |    |    |----seed                : Seed data auto generated from database insert/update/delete actions (if configured)
|    |    |----packages                 : Custom classes folder (mapped to Laravel namespace App/Custom )
|    |    |----tests                    : Custom tests for application
|    |    |----views                    : custom views folder (mapped to laravel folder resources/views/custom )
|
|
|----etc                                : docker etc mapping for linux
|    |----letsencrypt                   : https certs if configured
|----var                                : linux var folder
|    |----lib                           : linux var/lib folder
|    |    |----mysql                    : mariadb data dir

```


these will be the steps for adding a module
1. Designer -> Modules : add new module
2. Designer -> Models : all models under the module (db tables)
3. create folders views/<small case modulename>, packages/<ModuleName>
4. Assign to Roles so that users can access
